        Shanks is the only Yonkou who does not possess any kind of Devil Fruit
        powers. This separates him from the rest of the Yonkou as all of them
        have devil fruit powers. Big Mom has the Soru Soru no Mi, which allows
        her to take souls, Kaido has an ancient mythical Zoan that enables him
        to turn into an eastern dragon, and Blackbeard has two devils fruitsâ€”
        Yami Yami no Mi and Gura Gura no Mi. Yami Yami no Mi allowed Blackbeard
        to nullify the power of other devil fruits and Gura Gura no Mi allows
        him to create tremors. This just shows how powerful Shanks is even
        without a devil fruit.
